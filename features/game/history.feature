Feature: Game History
  As a player
  I need to play game
  So I can use it as needed

    Given I navigate to Tic Tac Toe page
    Then I should see Welcome message and subtitle for register
    When I enter "elahe" for PLAYER NAME
    And I click on Create Acount button
    Then I should see "Hello, elahe" for welcome user

  Scenario: Save game result after completion
    When the game is finished
    Then result should be stored in history
